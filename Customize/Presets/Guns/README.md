# Presets/Guns

## About

The gun preset plays a gun sound effect for every key pressed/every certain amount of characters per minute. The faster you type, the more powerful the gun (you can go from a pistol (1-6 characters per minute) to a handheld 360 machine powered rocket launcher decuple shot (250-3000 characters per minute, an optional bonus weapon will be available if you use only 1 finger

I have also decided to prompt the access to location information for 1 purpose (info will be stored locally, and will only detect certain buildings, I will try my best to do P2P encryption and other methods to make it as non-privacy invasive as possible. Locations will not be logged by default, it will only request to know what type of building you are in) as I want to prevent this from being used in schools, hospitals, and other public buildings, especially places of education, because guns in school is really not cool or funny, and I will try my best to prevent people terrorizing people like that. If all precautions fail, I will not defend you in court. Be a scumbag at your own risk.

**Permissions required:** `location` (data is not logged by default, and is accessed every 5 seconds while the gun preset is active. Data is heavily encrypted with E2EE (End to End Encryption) and every measure possible will be taken to protect user privacy.
