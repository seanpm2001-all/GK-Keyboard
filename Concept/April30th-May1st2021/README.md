# Concept

## From April 30th to May 1st 2021

### April 30th 2021 (nighttime)

GK Gunboard - Every keystrokes plays a gunshot sound. The faster you type, the more powerful the gun (go from pistol (1-6 cpm) to handheld 360 machine powered rocket launcher decuple shot (250-3000 cpm bonus weapon if you use only 1 finger

### May 1st 2021 (evening)

I have decided to expand on this idea, and make a full-on keyboard customization kit, with the original nighttime concept to be a sub-project within this project.

I have also decided to prompt the access to location information for 1 purpose (info will be stored locally, and will only detect certain buildings, I will try my best to do P2P encryption and other methods to make it as non-privacy invasive as possible. Locations will not be logged by default, it will only request to know what type of building you are in) as I want to prevent this from being used in schools, hospitals, and other public buildings, especially places of education, because guns in school is really not cool or funny, and I will try my best to prevent people terrorizing people like that. If all precautions fail, I will not defend you in court. Be a scumbag at your own risk.
